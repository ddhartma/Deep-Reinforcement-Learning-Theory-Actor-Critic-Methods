## Introduction <a name="what_is_reinforcement"></a>
- Reinforcement learning is **learning** what to do — **how to map situations to actions** — so as **to maximize a numerical reward** signal. The learner is not told which actions to take, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. (Sutton and Barto, [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html))
- Deep reinforcement learning refers to approaches where the knowledge is represented with a deep neural network

### Overview:
- ***Policy-Based Methods***: methods such as 
    - hill climbing
    - simulated annealing
    - adaptive noise scaling
    - cross-entropy methods
    - evolution strategies

- ***Policy Gradient Methods***:
    - REINFORCE
    - lower the variance of policy gradient algorithms

- ***Proximal Policy Optimization***:
    - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a cutting-edge policy gradient method

- ***Actor-Critic Methods***
    - how to combine value-based and policy-based methods
    - bringing together the best of both worlds, to solve challenging reinforcement learning problems



## Setup Instructions <a name="Setup_Instructions"></a>
The following is a brief set of instructions on setting up a cloned repository.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites: Installation of Python via Anaconda and Command Line Interaface <a name="Prerequisites"></a>
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Install Python 3.7 - 64 Bit

- Upgrade Anaconda via
```
$ conda upgrade conda
$ conda upgrade --all
```

- Optional: In case of trouble add Anaconda to your system path. Write in your CLI
```
$ export PATH="/path/to/anaconda/bin:$PATH"
```

### Clone the project <a name="Clone_the_project"></a>
- Open your Command Line Interface
- Change Directory to your project older, e.g. `cd my_github_projects`
- Clone the Github Project inside this folder with Git Bash (Terminal) via:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ddhartma/Sparkify-Project.git
```

- Change Directory
```
$ cd Sparkify-Project
```

- Create a new Python environment, e.g. spark_env. Inside Git Bash (Terminal) write:
```
$ conda create --name spark_env
```

- Activate the installed environment via
```
$ conda activate spark_env
```

- Install the following packages (via pip or conda)
```
numpy = 1.12.1
pandas = 0.23.3
matplotlib = 2.1.0
seaborn = 0.8.1
pyspark = 2.4.3
```

- Check the environment installation via
```
$ conda env list
```
